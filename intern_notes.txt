Cell2Fire Internship Meeting 4 June 2020

o Between now and our next meeting.
- learn about Python Unittest
- learn about github; make your own branch of Cell2Fire
- install Cell2Fire (you may need help with that)

o We should meet again soon

o At first will all do the same thing so we can learn and in a few
weeks we will divide the work.

o Note: this is almost all work that is done with terminals and
editors, there is very little clicking. Also, one must read carefully.

Notes that won't make sense yet but will after our next meeting:

  _ The directory structure for this repo is very unusual, but we will just
  live with it for now. (the setup.py lives in src, which is strange)

- For our first tests we will call the function Cell2FireC passing in args
(see main.py)

- parse_args can be given a list as input (or we could use mock)
