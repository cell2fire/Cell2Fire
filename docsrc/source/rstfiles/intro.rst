The fire environment is characterized by partitioning the landscape
into a large number of homogeneous cells and specifying the fuel,
weather, fuel moisture and topography attributes of each cell.  Fire
spread within each cell is assumed to be elliptical and governed by
spread rates predicted by any independent fire spread model (e.g. the
Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction System).  Cell2Fire exploits
parallel computation methods which allows users to run large-scale
simulations in short periods of time.  It includes powerful
statistical, graphical output, and spatial analysis features to
facilitate the display and analysis of projected fire growth.

This online documentation is an on-going project, expected to grow over
time. There is also an original draft of an academic paper on `arXiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09317v1>`_ and an updated version is currently under review.
