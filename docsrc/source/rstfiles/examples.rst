This example assumes you are running the program on a Unix based system.
To illustrate we use a 9 cell forest in which all the variables such as weather, wind speed etc. can be changed. These changes could easily be made in the delme63 folder.
After we make these changes the Simulator will provide us the necessary results as well as hourly data based on the spread of wildfire.

**We need to be in the correct directory to run this simulation. We could use the command line as shown below:**

.. code-block:: html
   :linenos:

   bash ../../contributed/delme63/go.bash

The results obtained would show the stats for each hour. At the end of the 4th hour all the 9 cells would have burned.
The results would also be stored in the following path:

.. code-block:: html
   :linenos:
   delme63/9cellsC1/Plots


**The hourly plots of the fire propagation is as shown below:**
