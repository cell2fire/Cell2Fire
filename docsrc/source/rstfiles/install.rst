Installation 
============

To be able to run the file will first need to download the zip file and extract
it in a folder in your preferred directory (I used Desktop)

On your terminal write

.. code-block:: html
   :linenos:
   
    cd Desktop/FolderName/src/Cell2Fire/Cell2FireC
    
from here you edit your make file to have the correct path to Eigen. Then run make in your terminal.
