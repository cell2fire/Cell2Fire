Installation 
============

If you are not a programmer, these instructions may be difficult. If
you get frustrated, jump to the section :ref:`docker_section`. Also, Windows
users who are not programmers should either install the Unix
subsystem, or use docker as described in :ref:`docker_section`

First, be sure that boost, eigen and gcc are installed on your computer. 

Download the zip file and extract
it in a folder in your preferred directory (I used Desktop). Or clone
the githup repository (these instructions assume you cloned in Desktop)

.. code-block:: html
   git clone https://github.com/cell2fire/Cell2Fire.git

Give a terminal command to cd to the C++ directory, e.g.,

.. code-block:: html
   :linenos:
   
    cd Desktop/Cell2Fire/cell2fire/Cell2FireC
    
and edit Makefile to have the correct path to Eigen. Then,

.. code-block:: html
   :linenos:
   
      make
      cd ../..   # (the working directory should now be Cell2Fire)
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      python setup.py develop
