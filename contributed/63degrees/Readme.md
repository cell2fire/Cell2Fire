## Wind from 63 degrees example

This example is based on the observation made by Dennis Boychuck that certain
wind angles can cause truncated head fire spread distances for
cellular models, particularly with 8 neighbors. One example he mentioned
is wind from the southwest at an angle of about 63 degrees.

Note that the weather files for cell2fire takes as input the wind direction
rather than the wind azimuth so the wind direction would be 360-63 = 297.
